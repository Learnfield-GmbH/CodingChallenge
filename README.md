# Skoove Coding Challenges

## The following rules apply to all tests:

- Supply clean, readable automated testing
  - Definitely unit and potentially other test layers you consider useful
- Supply clean code (e.g. SOLID principles, etc)
- Supply a scaleable, clean architecture
- Supply build / make / run instructions if required
- Preferably, provide the code in a Git repository

## Important notes

If your efforts exceed ~6 hours of work by a significant amount of work, please feel free to cut the task down into meaningful splits and document what's left, and how you would approach this.
