# Skoove Coding Challenges

## The following rules apply to all tests:

- Supply clean code (e.g. SOLID principles, etc)
- Supply clean architecture
- Supply clean, readable automated testing
  - Definitely unit and potentially other test layers you consider useful
- Supply build / make / run instructions if required
- Preferably, provide the code in a Git repository
